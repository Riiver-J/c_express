Smooth like butter
Like a criminal undercover
Gon' pop like trouble
Breakin' into your heart like that
Cool shade stunner
Yeah I owe it all to my mother
Hot like summer
Yeah I'm makin' you sweat like that
Break it down
Oh when I look in the mirror
I'll melt your heart into 2
I got that superstar glow so
Do the boogie like
Side step right left to my beat (heartbeat)
High like the moon rock with me baby
Know that I got that heat
Let me show you 'cause talk is cheap
Side step right left to my beat (heartbeat)
Get it, let it roll
Smooth like butter
Pull you in like no other
Don't need no Usher
To remind me you got it bad
Ain't no other
That can sweep you up like a robber
Straight up, I got ya
Makin' you fall like that
Break it down
Oh when I look in the mirror
I'll melt your heart into 2
I got that superstar glow so
Do the boogie like
Side step right left to my beat (heartbeat)
High like the moon rock with me baby
Know that I got that heat
Let me show you 'cause talk is cheap
Side step right left to my beat (heartbeat)
Get it, let it roll
Get it, let it roll
Get it, let it roll
